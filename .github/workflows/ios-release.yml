# This workflow relies on the following secrets:
# - GITHUB_TOKEN: Required for creating a release on GitHub.
# - COCOAPODS_TRUNK_TOKEN: Required for publishing a pod to Cocoapods.

    inputs:
      tag:
        description: >
          The tag (version) to be released (ex: 1.2.3).
        type: string
        required: true

      create-github-release:
        description: >
          Creates a single GitHub release and uploads artifacts for the specified extensions.  
          If the provided `tag` does not exist, it will be created.  
          This does **not** publish the pods to CocoaPods (use `pod-publish-extensions` for that).  

          **Format:** A comma-separated list of extensions.  
          **Syntax:** `"Extension1, Extension2, Extension3"`  
          **Example:** `"AEPServices, AEPCore"`
        type: string
        required: true
        default: ''

      release-dependency-frameworks:
        description: >
          **(Core-only parameter)**  
          A comma-separated list of extension frameworks to include as artifacts in the GitHub release.  
          The versions will be fetched from CocoaPods.  

          **Format:** A comma-separated list of extensions.  
          **Syntax:** `"Dependency1, Dependency2"`  
          **Example:** `"AEPRulesEngine"`
        type: string
        required: false
        default: ''

      pod-publish-extensions:
        description: >
          Publishes the specified extensions to CocoaPods.  
          Pods will be published in the order they are listed.  

          **Format:** A comma-separated list of extensions.  
          **Syntax:** `"Extension1, Extension2, Extension3"`  
          **Example:** `"AEPCore, AEPIdentity"`
        type: string
        required: true
        default: ''
